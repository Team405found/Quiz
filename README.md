# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To run the project at first you need to clone the repository. Then you have to open the terminal in your Cloned folder and run the command (npm install), then run the command (npm run dev) . Please ignore the parenthesis in the run command when you are typing in terminal. Then explore the project in your local host.
